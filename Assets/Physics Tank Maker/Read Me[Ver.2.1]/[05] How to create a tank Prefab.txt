(Notice.)
Tank prefabs must be placed under "Resources" folder in this project.

(Notice.)
Even when you change the tank settings in EditMode, the tank still has old settings when the tank is respawned in PlayMode.
Create a new prefab to respawn the tank having the new settings, or overwrite its prefab (not recommended).
