*** How to change the operation type***
(1) Select the top object of the tank in the Hierarchy window.
    

(2) Choose the "Input Device Type" in the Inspector window.
    
    [Input Device Type]
    Choose the inputting device type.
    (Notice.)
    This option is ignored when the tank has AI.

    (Notice.)
    If you have not finished setting up the "Input Manager", do not choose anything except for the "Mouse + KeyBoard (Default)".
    Otherwise you will find many errors such as "UnityException: Input Axis Horizontal2 is not setup" in?PlayMode.
